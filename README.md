# 🧠 TensorFlow Fashion-MNIST Image Classification
A complete end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for classifying Fashion-MNIST clothing images using TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, evaluate, and deploy a deep learning image classification model using the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**. The script (`classify_tf.py`) walks through every essential step—from loading the dataset and preprocessing images, to training a CNN, generating evaluation metrics, and saving the model for real-world use.

This repository is ideal for:
* Students learning machine learning
* Researchers and practitioners developing computer-vision models
* Anyone exploring **CNNs** with **TensorFlow**

## 🧰 Requirements
Make sure the following are installed:
* Python 3.9+
* TensorFlow 2.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-Learn

### Install Dependencies
